## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Since I've recently started learning Web Development, this was one of the first projects I've completed. It was an interesting project and I learned some stuff, mainly about JS.
I've learnd how to use onchnage event, and I've practiced a lot working with functions and DOM. I know this can be done in less lines of code, but considering technologies I know and experience I happy with how it currently looks mainly because I have done all of it.

### Continued development

In the future I'm looking to improve my skills, so my code is more optimized and also learn new technologies realted to both Front-end and Backend development.
